When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you want to easily share files and changes with other colloborators. It
also provides a great form of backup for your files as well.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It gives you more control over when you receive others' changes to make sure
a feature someone else is working on doesn't conflict with what you are working
on locally.
