When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you want to easily share files and changes with other colloborators. It
also provides a great form of backup for your files as well.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It gives you more control over when you receive others' changes to make sure
a feature someone else is working on doesn't conflict with what you are working
on locally.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

You clone a git repository to your machine to work on it locally. Forks are
clones made by GitHub so you can work with the initial repository without
needing permission to commit to that repository. Branches are on individual
repositories to allow you to make feature changes without messing up the
production code. You clone a repository if you just need the code on your
machine, you fork if you want to work on a repository you don't have access to
and want to share your code with others, and you branch if you just need to add
a feature to your own repository.
