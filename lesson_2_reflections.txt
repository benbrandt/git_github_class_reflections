What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init creates the hidden folder and initial metadata required to make a
repository. You need to do it so that you are able to start committing your
changes!


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that it only
includes the changes you want to commit to your repository. It is helpful
because it allows you to choose which files you want to add to a commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can select to add only the files that were part of a single change, commit
them and then stage the other files that need to be staged for a separate
commit.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful for testing out new features or elements without affecting
the production version of the code. They allow you to make new changes for
testing and bring them into the master branch at a later time.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help you see the flow of commits and changes, and what is and isn't
included on your current branch.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches together takes the commit history of both and merges those
changes in the files and adds the branch commits together on a single timeline.
It is represented on the diagram the way it is to show how and when the changes
were made and show what it means for them to come together in one branch. By
joining them you see that the tip of both branches is now the same commit.
